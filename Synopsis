EXPENSES TRACKER

Introduction:

To many young professionals earning their first salary, college students trying to get through college on a part-time job, or even professionals pushing themselves to invest, managing money can be a critical problem. They often overspend, putting themselves in a never-ending debt spiral. This project aims to help alleviate this problem by helping expense management with a user-friendly yet powerful tool. With the help of this app, many young salaried professionals can make aspirational purchases, like a car or their wedding, manage investments and so much more.
Our tool will have several features such as tax breakdowns, debt monitors, residual income limits, and a simple input interface that can be automated through the built-in rest API. The main UI will contain graphs and charts to make the breakdowns more understandable to the user. The tool will use live stock market valuations to present a real-time overview of your portfolio's value.
